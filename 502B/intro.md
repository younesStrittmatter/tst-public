# A Guide to Computational Modeling with [PsyNeuLink](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/PsyNeuLink/)

This guide explores computational techniques and concepts central to modern cognitive neuroscience, with practical
applications using [PsyNeuLink](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/PsyNeuLink/). It is designed for students, researchers, and practitioners 
who are interested in building and simulating cognitive and neural models.

The guide is divided into chapters. Each chapter covers a specific topic, such as decision making or
reinforcement learning, and includes a mix of theoretical background, practical examples, and exercises.

Some pages include interactive Jupyter notebooks that allow you to run code and experiment with the concepts. The
recommended way to use these notebooks is to open them in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). For this,
you will need a Google account. You can open the notebooks in Google Colab by clicking on the launch  button at the 
top of the page. This will allow you to run the code without installing anything on your computer.


## Prerequisites

This guide introduces PsyNeuLink, a Python package for building cognitive and neural models. It assumes familiarity 
with Python, Numpy, and basic programming concepts.

We recommend completing the 
[PsyNeuLink Beginner Tutorial](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/PsyNeuLink/index_logo_with_text.html#tutorial) 
to gain foundational knowledge of the PsyNeuLink environment, unless you are already familiar with it.

## When Things Go Wrong

This guide is a living document, and we are constantly working to improve the language and its documentation.

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, let us know by:
- Opening an issue on this guide's [GitHub repository]({{ repo_url }}).
- Reporting bugs related to PsyNeuLink in the [PsyNeuLink repository](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/PsyNeuLink).

Your feedback is invaluable in improving this guide and the PsyNeuLink ecosystem.
