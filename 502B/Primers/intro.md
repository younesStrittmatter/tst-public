## Overview

Computational modeling in psychology and cognitive neuroscience relies heavily on mathematical concepts. This primer
reviews foundational topics such as *vectors*, *matrices*, and the *logistic function*. It also introduces the basics
of a simple neural network (*perceptron*) through a XOR task, providing a hands-on understanding of the math behind
more complex models.
