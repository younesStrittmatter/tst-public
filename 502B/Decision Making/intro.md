# Decision Making

## Overview

The study of decision-making processes across species can benefit from approaches such as genetic analysis, comparative neuroanatomy, and behavioral experiments. A unified investigation into these mechanisms requires a computational model capable of formalizing the parameters and processes involved. Here, we introduce the *drift diffusion model* which emerges as an excellent choice for this purpose. This model provides a robust framework to explore and understand decision-making dynamics across various species and contexts.
